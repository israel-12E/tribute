                    <strong>1972</strong> - He was defended his PhD thesis on "Programm Structure and Computational
                    Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, never officially received
                    his PhD degree.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1983</strong> - Thompson and himself received the Turing Award for their development of generic
                    operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system. His
                    Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1990</strong> - Thompson and himself received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the
                    Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating
                    system and the C programming language".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1997</strong> - Thompson and himself were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for
                    co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1999</strong> - Thompson and himself jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998
                    from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language
                    which, according to the citation for the medal "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software,
                    and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American
                    leadership in the information Age".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2005</strong> - The Industrial Research institute Awarded in recognition of his contribution to
                    society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2011</strong> - He, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan prize for information and
                    Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system.
                </li>
